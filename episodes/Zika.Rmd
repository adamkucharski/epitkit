## Introduction

In this unit, we will address the construction of a simple deterministic model, specifically for the Zika virus, a disease that triggered a major epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean and was declared a public health emergency of international concern. Using previous knowledge of epidemic theory, we will build a deterministic SIR model that incorporates demographic aspects.

To construct this model, we will learn about the dynamics of interaction between humans and vectors, as well as the fundamental parameters that govern these biological processes. By constructing a diagram, we will examine these relationships and formulate equations that describe the behavior of the system. These equations will be the basis for simulating the model in the R programming language. We will also propose and model intervention strategies.

Through the analysis of the model, we will evaluate the potential impact of this epidemic on society, contextualizing some of these interventions in Latin America. Additionally, we will reinforce and apply key topics such as: SIR Model, Herd Immunity, Parameters, and control interventions (fumigation, bed nets, and vaccination) for a Vector-borne Disease (VBD).

## **Topic 6: Zika Model in R**

In this section, we will put into use the knowledge acquired about Zika, the mechanisms involved in transmission, and the model equations. The goal is to build it in R.

The only package required for modeling is deSolve, which allows solving differential equations. Additionally, to handle data and plot results, we recommend using tidyverse and cowplot.

## 6.1 Start practice in R

To start our practice in **R**, please open an **R project** and create a new document. In this document, we need to load the functions we just explained. If you have difficulties with this process, please review the **Introduction to R** unit.

install.packages(deSolve) \# deSolve package to solve differential equations

Once the deSolve package is installed, please load the packages with the following lines of code, copy them into your R script, and execute them.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(deSolve)

library(tidyverse)

library(cowplot)
```

[![](fig/dudas.png){width="100"}](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epitkit/Banco_errores.html)  
  
</center>

Remember that to create a model, we need compartments, initial conditions, parameters, and equations.

For this model in R, we will start by defining the parameters, that is, all those values that have been collected through research and are part of the disease's behavior. In the previous section, we talked about them and completed them in a table. It's time to enter them into R.

**Instruction**: Please take the table you worked on earlier and enter the value of each of these parameters.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
### NOTE: 
It is important to remember that in R, you can use previously created objects to perform calculations. For example, the parameter muv is the inverse of the parameter Lv, that is, muv = 1/Lv. Therefore, in R, you can assign this value directly with muv <- 1/Lv. It is not necessary to perform the division and manually assign the result.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 6.2 Model Equations
Now that we have entered the parameters into the script, it is time to use the equations we wrote earlier, which allow us to know the number of individuals in each of the six compartments as a function of time. Three compartments for humans and three compartments for mosquitoes, identified by an **h** (for humans) and a **v** (for mosquitoes). For humans, we have the compartments; susceptible, infectious, and recovered (hence the word **SIR**) and for mosquitoes, the compartments are: susceptible, exposed, and infectious (**SEI**).

::::::::::::::::::: checklist
### Compartments
-   $S_h$ : Susceptible humans

-   $I_h$ : Infectious humans

-   $R_h$ : Recovered humans (immune to reinfection)

-   $S_v$ : Susceptible vectors

-   $E_v$ : Exposed vectors

-   $I_v$ : Infectious vectors
:::::::::::::::::::


For this model, we will use the following differential equations:

### 6.2.1 Humans

$$\ \frac{dSh}{dt}  = \alpha_h N_h - \beta_h \frac {I_v}{N_h}S_h - \mu_h  S_h $$

$$\ \frac{dIh}{dt}  = \beta_h \frac {I_v}{N_h}S_h - (\gamma + \mu_h) I_h $$\

$$\ \frac{dRh}{dt}  = \gamma I_h  - \mu_h R_h$$

### 6.2.2 Vectors

$$\ \frac{dSv}{dt}  = \alpha_v N_v  - \beta_v \frac{ I_h} {N_h}S_v  - \mu_v Sv$$

$$\ \frac{dE_v}{dt}  = \beta_v \frac{I_h} {N_h}S_v- (\delta + \mu_v) Ev$$\

$$\ \frac{dI_v}{dt}  = \delta Ev - \mu_v I_v$$

## 6.3 Formula to calculate $R_0$ (Basic Reproductive Number)

Formula needed to estimate $R_0$:

$$ R_0 = \frac{mb^2 p_h p_v \delta}{\mu_v (\mu_v+\delta)(\mu_h+\gamma)} $$

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

**Instruction**: Translate the equations into R

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Humans
         dSh   <-  alphah * Nh - betah * (Iv/Nh) * Sh - muh * Sh   
         dIh   <-______ * (Iv/Nh) * Sh - (____ + _____) * Ih
         dRh   <-  ______ * Ih  - ______ * Rh
         
 # Mosquitoes
         dSv  <-  alphav * Nv - _____ * (Ih/Nh) * Sv - _____ * Sv 
         dEv  <-  _____ * (Ih/Nh) * Sv - (____ + _____)* Ev
         dIv  <-  _____ * Ev - _____ * Iv

```
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Once we know how to translate the equations into code, we will proceed to execute the model. For this, we will use the ode function from the deSolve package.

We will start by creating the function (which will later be used in the **fun** argument). To do this, it is necessary to translate the Zika model equations into **R**. Below you will find the already constructed function `modelo_zika` for you to replace the equations you completed above.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 
### Challenge 3

**Instruction**: Replace the incomplete equations in the following code with the complete Zika model equations you worked on in the previous instruction.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Simple deterministic model (fun)
modelo_zika <- function(time, state, parameters) {
  
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters))
, # local environment to evaluate derivatives
       {
         # Humans
         dSh   <-  ____ * Nh - ____ * (Iv/Nh) * Sh - ____ * Sh   
         dIh   <-  ____ * (Iv/Nh) * Sh - (____ + ____) * Ih
         dRh   <-  ____ * Ih  - ____ * Rh
         
         # Mosquitoes
         dSv  <-  alphav * Nv - ____ * (Ih/Nh) * Sv - ____ * Sv 
         dEv  <-  ____ * (Ih/Nh) * Sv - (____ + ____)* Ev
         dIv  <-  ____ * Ev - ____ * Iv
         
         list(c(dSh, dIh, dRh, dSv, dEv, dIv))
       }
  )
}

```

       {
         # Humans
         dSh   <-  alphah * Nh - betah * (Iv/Nh) * Sh - muh * Sh
         dIh   <-  betah * (Iv/Nh) * Sh  - (gamma + muh) * Ih
         dRh   <-  gamma * Ih  - muh * Rh
         
         # Vectors
         dSv   <-  alphav * Nv - betav * (Ih/Nh) * Sv - muv * Sv 
         dEv   <-  betav * (Ih/Nh) * Sv - (delta + muv)* Ev
         dIv   <-  delta * Ev - muv * Iv
         
         dx    <- c(dSh, dIh, dRh, dSv, dEv, dIv)
        list(c(dSh, dIh, dRh, dSv, dEv, dIv))

## 6.4 Solving the System

To solve the system, it is necessary to create the three missing arguments (**times**, **parms**, and **y**) to use the ode function.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 
### Challenge 4

**Instruction:** For `times` and `parms`, copy the code below and execute it.

```{r}
# Time sequence (times)
time <- seq(1, 365 * TIME , by = 1)
# Parameters (parms)
params <- c(
  muv      = muv,     
  muh      = muh, 
  alphav   = alphav,
  alphah   = alphah,
  gamma    = gamma,   
  delta    = delta,   
  betav    = betav,       
  betah    = betah,   
  Nh       = Nh,      
  Nv       = Nv
)
```
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the code you executed, time (**times**) and parameters (**params**) were created. We still need to create the **y** argument, which we will develop in the next section.

### 6.4.1. **Initial conditions of the system (y)**

To define the initial conditions, remember that the scenario to be modeled in this exercise is for a date **before the first case is reported**. Therefore, these values should reflect that context.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
**Reflection:** What initial conditions would each of the compartments have?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 
### Challenge 5

**Instruction:** Complete the blanks according to what you have learned in the tutorial.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Initial conditions of the system (y)
start <- c(Sh = _______ ,        # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
            Ih = _______ ,        # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
            Rh = _______ ,        # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
            Sv = _______ ,        # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
            Ev = _______ ,        # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
            Iv = _______ )        # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
```
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor 
### Solution 5

```{r, include = full_version}
# Initial conditions of the system (y)
start <- c(Sh = Nh ,      # Initial number of Sh at time 0
           Ih = 0,        # Initial number of Ih at time 0
           Rh = 0,        # Initial number of Rh at time 0
           Sv = Nv,     # Initial number of Sv at time 0
           Ev = 0,        # Initial number of Ev at time 0
           Iv = 0)        # Initial number of Iv at time 0

### 6.4.2 ode Function

Once all the necessary arguments are created, it is time to enter them into ode. Remember the four arguments of ode and what they correspond to:

-   **y**:**start**. Vector created with the initial conditions of the six compartments.

-   **times**:**time**. Vector with the time sequence.

-   **fun:modelo_zika**. Function that contains the necessary equations to simulate the model.

-   **parms:parameters.** Vector in which the necessary parameters to simulate the model were collected.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 
### Challenge 6

**Instruction**: Complete the blanks according to what you have worked on so far.

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Solve the equations
output <- ode(y      =   _______ , # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
              times  = _______ ,   # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
              fun    = _______ ,   # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
              parms  = _______  # COMPLETE AND COMMENT
) %>%
  as.data.frame() # Convert to data frame
```
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor 
### Solution 6

```{r, include = full_version}
# Solve the equations
output <- ode(y      = start,     # Initial conditions
             times  = time,      # Time
             fun    = modelo_zika, # Model
             parms  = params    # Parameters
) %>%
  as.data.frame() # Convert to data frame

### 6.4.3 **Introducing the first case**

Now that we have all the compartments defined, it is time to introduce an infectious individual into the model to start the epidemic.

::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
**Reflection:** What do you think is more likely, that an infectious human or an infectious mosquito enters a population (in another country)?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

For our hypothetical case, let's assume that a person got infected in Brazil while on vacation and later returned to the city \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (the city you defined at the beginning of the exercise) as the first infectious subject in this population. In this context, the compartment of infectious humans will then have one individual, **Ih** = 1, and the compartment of susceptible humans will have one less individual, **Sh** = **Nh** - 1.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

**Hint:** Change the initial conditions (start) in R so that Ih = 1 and Sh = Nh - 1.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor 

### Solution

```{r, include = full_version}
# Initial conditions of the system (y)

start <- c(Sh = Nh ,      # Initial number of Sh at time 0            
            Ih = 0,        # Initial number of Ih at time 0            
            Rh = 0,        # Initial number of Rh at time 0            
            Sv = Nv-1,     # Initial number of Sv at time 0            
            Ev = 0,        # Initial number of Ev at time 0            
            Iv = 1)        # Initial number of Iv at time 0 
```

```{r, include = full_version}
# Solve the equations
output <- ode(y      = start,     # Initial conditions
             times  = time,      # Time
             fun    = modelo_zika, # Model
             parms  = params    # Parameters
) %>%
  as.data.frame() # Convert to data frame
```

## 6.5 **Now we will run the model!**

**At this point, you have completed all the missing information in the script to run the model.**

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
**Instruction:** Execute each set of lines in the script seen earlier, that is, execute the sections: List of parameters, the section Simple deterministic model (where you built the model), the sections Time sequence (time (times)), Parameters (parameters (parms)), the section Initial conditions of the system (start (y)), and the final section Solve the equations.

**Instruction:** Verify that no errors appear. In case of an error, please check the code for any typos and ensure that no other characters that do not belong, such as "\_\_\_\_\_" the dashes for completion, are left in the code.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## 6.6 **Visualizing the results**

**In our course, we will use ggplot for data visualization. It is important to review Unit 4. Data Visualization in ggplot**

Remember that the time unit of the Zika model is already defined from the parameters as **days**.

However, if you want to visualize the results in weeks, months, or years, you can do so from the model results (`output$time`). To do this, you can use the following code.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 
### Challenge 7

To have a more meaningful visualization of the results, convert the time units from *days* to *years* and *weeks*.

```{r eval = TRUE}
# Create time options for years and weeks 
output$years <- output$time/365
output$weeks <- output$time/7
```
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 6.7 **Visualize and analyze the first epidemic**

Let's start by visualizing the first epidemic. Since it is a one-year period, let's visualize the graphs in weeks.

Instruction: Execute the code below and analyze the resulting graphs.

```{r p1, include = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Review the first epidemic
p1e <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Ih, x = weeks)) +
  geom_line(color = 'firebrick', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Population of infectious humans') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Weeks') +
 coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,10000)) #create graph of infectious human population
p2e <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Rh, x = weeks)) +
  geom_line(color = 'olivedrab', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Recovered human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Weeks') +
 coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,100000))  #create graph of recovered human population


plot_grid(p1e, p2e) #create comparative graph of infectious human population and recovered human population
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
**Reflection:** What can you observe in the graph? Look closely at the Y-axis. What proportion of humans are infectious at the same time?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

To have more clarity on this, we can create graphs of the proportions:

```{r p3, include = TRUE}
# Review the first epidemic with proportions
p1p <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Ih/(Sh+Ih+Rh), x = weeks)) +
  geom_line(color = 'firebrick', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Population of infectious humans') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Proportion') + xlab('Weeks') +
 coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1)) #create graph of infectious human population
p2p <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Rh/(Sh+Ih+Rh), x = weeks)) +
  geom_line(color = 'olivedrab', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Recovered human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Proportion') + xlab('Weeks') +
 coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1))  #create graph of recovered human population


plot_grid(p1p, p2p) #create comparative graph of infectious human population and recovered human population
```

**General Behavior (Human Population)**

We have already observed the first epidemic; it is time to project the epidemic over a longer period.

**Instruction:** Go back to the parameters and change the TIME parameter to 100 years. Execute the following block of code and observe how many outbreaks occur in the human population and the size of each outbreak.

```{r p4, include = TRUE}
# # Review the general behavior of the model for 100 years
p1h <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = (Rh + Ih + Sh), x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'grey68', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Total human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Years')
p2h <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Sh, x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'royalblue', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Susceptible human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Years')
p3h <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Ih, x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'firebrick', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Infectious human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Years')
p4h <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Rh, x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'olivedrab', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Recovered human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Years')
plot_grid(p1h, p2h, p3h, p4h, ncol = 2)
```

**General Behavior (Mosquito Population)**

**Instruction:** Execute the following block of code and observe how many outbreaks occur in the mosquito population and the size of each outbreak. Compare the graphs with the human population graphs.

```{r}
# Review the general behavior of the model
p1v <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = (Sv + Ev + Iv), x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'grey68', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Total mosquito population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Years')
p2v <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Sv, x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'royalblue', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Susceptible mosquito population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Years')
p3v <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Ev, x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'orchid', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Exposed mosquito population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Years')
p4v <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Iv, x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'firebrick', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Infectious mosquito population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Number') + xlab('Years')
plot_grid(p1v, p2v, p3v, p4v, ncol = 2)

```

**Proportion**

**Instruction:** Execute the following block of code and compare it with the graphs generated for the human population.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Sh/(Sh+Ih+Rh), x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'royalblue', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Susceptible human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Proportion') + xlab('Years') +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1))
p2 <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Ih/(Sh+Ih+Rh), x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'firebrick', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Infectious human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Proportion') + xlab('Years') +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1))
p3 <- ggplot(data = output, aes(y = Rh/(Sh+Ih+Rh), x = years)) +
  geom_line(color = 'olivedrab', linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle('Recovered human population') +
  theme_bw() + ylab('Proportion') + xlab('Years') +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1))
plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 2)  
```
