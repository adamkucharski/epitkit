## Question Bank

### [How to install a package or "library" in R?]{#instr}

To install a package in R, you can do it through:

-   We recommend that you do it through the function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("package")
```

Some packages that are in their development phase can be installed from the latest version on GitHub or other locations using the remotes or pak packages.

-   Another option is to use the require function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("package")) {
  install.packages("package")
}
```

This option is useful because it installs the package if it is not already installed. It can be combined with remotes or pak.

-   Use the RStudio interface:

    1.  Click on the `Packages` window.

    2.  Press the `Install` button.

    3.  Type the name of the package(s) to install.

    4.  Press the `Install` button.

### [How to use a function?]{#funcr}

          If the function belongs to an R package, it can be done in two ways:

-   Call the name of the R package and put two colons `(::)` and then call the name of the function. Now you must fill in the arguments.

```{r eval = FALSE}
package::function_name(arguments)
```

-   Load the R package with `library`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library("package")
```

and once loaded, call the function name and fill in the arguments.

```{r eval = FALSE}
function_name(arguments)
```

It is important to have the package installed beforehand. If you have any questions, go to [How to install a package in R?](instr)

-             If the function was created by you and is in the global environment:

Simply call the function by its name and provide the necessary arguments:

```{r eval = FALSE}
your_function_name(arguments)
```

### How to load a package or "library"?

Some options to load a package are:

-   The recommended way is to use the library function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library("package")
```

-   Using the RStudio interface:

    1.  Go to the lower right section to the `Packages` tab.

    2.  Click on the box in front of each function, this will activate the `library` function.

### If I load the libraries, do I have to load them every time I want to use the function?

No, you only need to load them once per R session. However, if you close your RStudio or open a new project, it counts as a new session, so you need to load them again to work.

### Can I deactivate a library that I have already loaded without restarting R?

Yes, it is possible in two ways:

-   Use the `detach` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
detach("package:package", unload = TRUE)
```

-   Using the RStudio interface:

    1.  Go to the lower right section to the `Packages` tab.

    2.  Click on the box in front of each function (if the box has a checkmark, the package is loaded; if the box is empty, the package is not loaded), this will activate the `detach` function. ***Warning*****: If you press the x symbol next to the package, it will uninstall it.**

### I don't see the result of my code.

This can happen for several reasons:

-   If you save the result using the assignment symbol (e.g., `name <- "Laura"`), it will appear in the global environment (upper right section) and will not be executed in the console unless you call the object, that is,

    1.  put the object name in the console and execute it (pressing `Enter`).

    2.  or in the script or RMarkdown Chunk, press `Control + Enter` on Windows or `Command + Enter` on Mac.

-   Some necessary library is missing. Check that all the necessary libraries are loaded at the beginning of the script.

-   There are errors in the code. Verify that there are no errors that prevent the code from executing correctly. When you run the code in the console, you will see some error alerts that the code may have.

-   The script has not been fully executed. Make sure to run the entire script so that all lines of code are executed in the correct order.

-   The script has not been fully executed. Make sure to run the entire script so that all lines of code are executed in the correct order.

### Common errors when using `ggplot`

-   Incorrect syntax:

    1.  Using `++` instead of `+` to concatenate functions.

    2.  It can also happen that the `+` is on the next line; it is important to note that to concatenate functions, it must be at the end of the previous line to the one you want to concatenate.

-   Not specifying aesthetics:

    1.  Not including `aes()`.
    2.  Not defining `aes()` correctly, for example, not indicating x or y.
    3.  While aes can sometimes be at the beginning, the geometry, or divided into sections, it is essential that it is always present.

-   Missing data:

The column mentioned in aes() does not exist in the dataset. Using the wrong name, remember that R is case-sensitive, so `VariableX` is different from `variableX` or `variablex`.

-   Missing libraries:

Before working with `ggplot`, always remember to load the library with `library`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

-   Errors in `geom`:

```         
Selecting the wrong geom for the type of data you want to represent.

### `filter` does not work

This can happen for several reasons:
```

-   The `dplyr` package is not loaded. Make sure to include `library(dplyr)` or `library(tidyverse)` in your script and run it in each new session.

-   There are function name conflicts with other packages. Use `dplyr::filter()` to specify that you want to use the `filter` function from `dplyr`.

-   The data may not be in the expected format. Verify that the column you are filtering exists and has the appropriate values.

`filter` accepts logical conditions to select rows. Let's see some examples:

-          Specific values:

```{r eval = FALSE}
covid19 %>% filter(status == "Deceased")
```

-          Value ranges:

```{r eval = FALSE}
covid19 %>% filter(notification_date >= "2020-01-01" & notification_date <= "2020-12-31")
```

-          Multiple conditions:

```{r eval = FALSE}
covid19 %>% filter(status == "Deceased" & country_name == "Colombia")
```

-          Conditions with functions:

```{r eval = FALSE}
covid19 %>% filter(grepl("Colombia", country_name))
```

To learn more about filter, check the [documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html).

### Where is the object I created?

When an object is created, it is stored in the global environment. We can see the global environment in the R interface located in the upper right section.

### The pipe `%>%` does not work.

Remember the following points: 

- It is important to load a library that contains the pipe beforehand. For example: `magrittr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, or `purrr`. 
- The pipe must be at the end of the line to be connected. Not at the beginning of the connected line:

### How to avoid accidents? {#prevention}

When storing changes in the object where the dataframe is stored, it is advisable to take some precautions to avoid losing information:

-   Create a backup of the data in objects:

o   Make regular backups during the process. It is recommended to make an initial copy to avoid reloading the base. After performing some processes, especially those that take time, it is advisable to create backups. You can create as many as you deem necessary. It is recommended to create notes to identify each process.

![](fig/bpaccidentes.png)

-   Create a backup of the data in files:

o   Just like saving in objects, it is a good idea to save the data that has already undergone some processes on the computer's disk. This prevents data loss if the session crashes or the computer shuts down. How often to save depends on the person performing the processing.

![](fig/bpaccidentes1.png)

-   Tests before storing:

o   Perform tests of the desired changes before saving them definitively.

o   Example: If you want to transform a variable to numeric, before storing it and ending up with unwanted `NAs` in the data, it is advisable to test if those `NAs` will be generated.

![](fig/bpaccidentes2.png)

-   Create backup variables:

o   Sometimes when transforming a variable, it is better to create a new one that stores the content of the transformation. This avoids the risk of losing information when transforming a variable.

![](fig/bpaccidentes3.png)

-   Be careful when storing:

o   Do not accidentally store transformed tables or objects.

o   For example, if we create a table to see if the variable changed as desired and then reuse the code and add the assignment in front, we would store the table and lose the information that the object had.

![](fig/bpaccidentes4.png)

### My dataframe changed unexpectedly.

When we have accidents with our data, some options are:

-          Check the damage and see if it is repairable. For example, if the wrong character was changed in a text string.

-          Load the data from a backup. If we have created backups of the process, we can avoid long processing times. These backups include backup variables or backup objects (see [How to avoid accidents?](Banco_errores.Rmd#prevention)).

### Using the `rename` function.

1.      Call the dataset.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data
```

2.      Use the pipe `%>%` to link it to the `rename` function.

3.      Call the `rename` function and write the new column name first, followed by the existing column name you want to change.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data <- data %>% rename(newname = oldname)
```

n.      Select some rows from a group of data.

1.      Call the dataset.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data
```

2.      Use the pipe `%>%` to link it to the `group_by` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data %>% group_by(group_variable)
```

The `group_by` function will create groups of data based on a specified variable, allowing you to perform other actions such as selecting the data in the header of each group.

4.      Then use the function, for example, we could use `head` only for the data in the header of each group.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data <- data %>% group_by(variable_of_interest) %>% head()
```

### How to use `summarise`?

1.      Call the dataset.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data
```

2.      Use the pipe `%>%` to link it to the `summarise` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data %>% summarise()
```

The `summarise` function cannot be used directly; therefore, it must be used with an argument inside, for example:

a.      Get the average.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(variable_of_interest))
```

b.      Get the standard deviation.

```{r eval = FALSE}
data %>% 
  summarise(sd = sd(variable_of_interest))
```

This function can be used with prior grouping (`group_by`) to obtain these values for each group, for example,

```{r eval = FALSE}
data %>%  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(variable_of_interest), 
    sd = sd(variable_of_interest))
```

### Errors related to groups (group_by and ungroup)
  
- A very common error is that the object is stored grouped (`group_by`), given that the ungrouping action was not performed at the end. This can generate errors such as incorrect calculations, summaries by group instead of on the entire dataset, and problems when performing subsequent operations on the dataset. Therefore, we recommend always using (`ungroup`) before storing. To use `ungroup()`, simply put it at the end.

```{r eval=FALSE}
data <- data %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  data_processing(...) %>% 
  ungroup() 
```
  
Let's see an example of an error that can occur due to not ungrouping:
 
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
#example dataframe
blood_type <- c("A", "B", "O","AB")
rh <- sample(c("+", "-"), 10, replace = TRUE)
day <-c(1:5)
heart_rate <- sample(60:100, 200, replace = TRUE)
respiratory_rate <- sample(12:20, 200, replace = TRUE)
df <- data.frame(blood_type, rh, day, heart_rate, respiratory_rate)

#summary by columns
by_day <- df %>%
  group_by(blood_type,rh, day) %>%
  summarize(
    hr = mean(heart_rate), 
    rr = mean(respiratory_rate)
  )
```

Let's create a variable that contains unique ids for each row.

```{r}
by_day %>% mutate(id = row_number())
```

As you can see in the id column, instead of unique identifiers, we have repeating ids. Why did this happen if each row is different?
  
The reason for this problem lies in the fact that the data is still grouped. Even if we don't directly apply `ungroup` as explained before, we can still fix it.

Let's see how it wouldn't be fixed first. A common mistake when trying to fix this problem is to apply the ungroup function without storing the result.
```{r}
# incorrect application of ungroup
by_day %>% ungroup() 

# although it ungroups the object for printing, 
# as long as it is not stored, the object will remain grouped
by_day %>% mutate(id = row_number())
```
As you can see, the problem has not been fixed.

To fix it, we can either include `ungroup` from the beginning when creating the `by_day` object or apply the change and save it in the object: 

```{r}
# now we are storing the ungrouping
by_day_ungrouped <- by_day %>% ungroup()

by_day_ungrouped %>% mutate(id = row_number())
```
As you can see, now we have each row with its own id.


Warning: It is important to clarify that ungrouping in the previous scenarios would go after the operation; however, in this case, it would go before the operation.
    
    

### When I try to create a PDF in RMarkdown, I get an error.

If the file is generated correctly in other formats except for PDF, one of the most common situations is that LaTeX is not installed: RMarkdown needs LaTeX to generate PDFs. Make sure you have LaTeX installed on your system. 

To install LaTeX from RStudio, you can use the TinyTeX package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Configure RStudio:

Go to Tools > Global Options > Sweave.

Make sure the "Typeset PDF" option is set to use TinyTeX.
