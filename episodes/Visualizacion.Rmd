**Content Development** (develop each of the topics considering the table of contents)

## Introduction

In the field of data science and decision-making, the ability to transform data into understandable and impactful information is essential. This unit will provide an introduction to the tools needed to turn datasets into graphs. In this unit, we will use ggplot2, a powerful R graphics library based on the grammar of graphics, to create impactful visualizations.

## Topic 1: Principles of the Grammar of Graphics with `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` is an R package based on the grammar of graphics that allows visualizing data in a consistent and structured way.

`ggplot2` gets its name from the abbreviation of the term grammar of graphics (gg). The grammar of graphics refers to a conceptual approach proposed and developed by Leland Wilkinson for creating graphics, which served as the basis for the development of `ggplot2` by Hadley Wickham.

The grammar of graphics provides a conceptual framework for thinking about how to construct and understand data visualizations in a coherent and structured way. In simple terms, the grammar of graphics breaks down a graph into its fundamental components and defines how these components combine to represent data.

::: checklist
### These basic components are:

**1. Data:** represents the data we want to visualize. It can be a data table (data.frame) in R or another data source.

**2. Aesthetics:** define how the attributes of the data are mapped to visual properties of the graph, such as position on the X-axis (x), position on the Y-axis (y), color, shape, size, etc. This is specified using the `aes()` function in `ggplot2`.

**3. Geometry:** represents the way the data is visualized in the graph, such as points, lines, bars, areas, etc. Each type of graph has its corresponding function in `ggplot2`, such as `geom_point()` for a scatter plot or `geom_bar()` for a bar chart.

**4. Scale:** defines how the data values are mapped to visual values, such as the range of colors or the range of the axes. `ggplot2` automatically adjusts the scales, but we can also customize them with functions like `scale_log10()`, `scale_x_continuous()`, or `scale_color_manual()`.

**5. Facets:** allow dividing the data into subsets and displaying them in multiple panels (facets) according to certain variables. We can use `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` in `ggplot2` to implement this functionality.

**6. Themes:** control the overall visual appearance of the graph, such as titles, axis labels, backgrounds, etc. We can customize the theme with the `theme()` function in `ggplot2`.

For example, a classic structure of a scatter plot would be:

```         
ggplot(data, # The data

   aes(x, y) # The aesthetics
)+
   geom_point() # the geometry
```

## Topic 2: Examples of Using the Grammar of Graphics with ggplot

Here we will explain how you can use this tool on your computer. As you progress, try to replicate the exercises.

::: callout
#### **NOTE.**

To make its use more versatile, it is recommended to understand the functionality of the dplyr package and the use of pipes (`%>%`). You can review these topics in Unit 1 of this module "Introduction to R and RStudio". `ggplot2` is contained within the Tidyverse library. Additionally, Tidyverse includes other libraries such as dplyr, which in turn includes pipes (`%>%`). For more details on Tidyverse, see the unit "Introduction to R and RStudio".
:::

For the practical exercises in this unit, it is necessary to load the following libraries:

```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Now, we will see each of the components to create data graphs with `ggplot2` through a practical exercise. A data table (a structure with rows and columns) is required to be used in the aesthetics of the graphs. Prior to using `ggplot2`, it is often necessary to perform a data cleaning and organization process. For this practical exercise, we will use a clean dataset that allows us to create visualizations without the need for pre-processing the data.

::: callout
The data table for this exercise can be found at:
<https://github.com/TRACE-LAC/TRACE-LAC-data/blob/main/otros/muestra_covid.RDS?raw=true>
:::

Once you have downloaded the data to your computer and placed it in the data folder of your project, you can execute the following command:

```{r}
covid19 <- readRDS("data/muestra_covid.RDS")
```

Once the data table is obtained, we will explore the data to understand its current state and review which variables we could use for visualizations. For this, we use one of the functions seen in the unit "Introduction to R and RStudio" called `glimpse`. Use it and check the structure of the data table

```{r}
glimpse(covid19)
```

### Aesthetics

In the context of the grammar of graphics, aesthetics refer to how we map the attributes of our data to visual properties in the graph. These visual properties can be elements such as position on the X-axis (x), position on the Y-axis (y), color, shape, size, etc. By mapping these attributes, we can create visualizations that allow us to understand and communicate patterns and relationships in the data effectively.

In `ggplot2`, the main function for specifying aesthetics is `aes()`. Below are some examples to illustrate how to use aesthetics in `ggplot2`.

#### Example 1: Scatter Plot

Suppose we have a table with the variables x and y. We want to create a scatter plot where the x variable is mapped to the X-axis and the y variable to the Y-axis. Additionally, we want the points to be colored according to the group variable. Using the `aes()` function in `ggplot2`, it is possible to assign these variables to the corresponding visual attributes of the graph, as shown in the following example.

Consider the covid19 dataset we loaded earlier. The requirement is to create a scatter plot showing the number of cases by report date and disaggregated by sex. For this, we first organize the data to create a summary table with the information we want to graph, using the functions seen in the unit "Introduction to R and RStudio" as follows:

```{r}
covid19_resumen <- covid19 %>%
  group_by(fecha_reporte_web, sexo) %>%
  summarise(casos = n())
```

Then, we can use the aesthetics of the `ggplot2` graphs by specifying the variables to use in each dimension. In this case, on the X-axis, we will have the time variable (fecha_reporte_web), and on the Y-axis, the number of cases (casos). To see the disaggregation by sex, we will use one of the attributes such as color. These instructions can be followed with the following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_resumen,
       aes(x = fecha_reporte_web, y = casos, colour = sexo)) +
  geom_point()
```

The visualization we generate is as follows:

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_resumen,
       aes(x = fecha_reporte_web, y = casos, colour = sexo)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Geometry

Geometry represents the way the data is visualized in the graph, such as points, lines, bars, areas, etc. Each type of graph has its corresponding function in `ggplot2`, such as `geom_point()` for a scatter plot or `geom_bar()` for a bar chart.

::: checklist
In the following table, some examples of the different types of geometries most commonly used in `ggplot2` with their corresponding commands are shown:

![](fig/tipogeom.png)

:::

#### Example 2: Line Chart

Suppose we want to visualize the evolution of the number of covid-19 cases over time. For this, we first need to prepare the dataset that will form the graph:

```{r}
covid19_fecha <- covid19 %>%
  group_by(fecha_reporte_web) %>%
  summarise(casos = n())
```

Once the dataset is ready, we proceed to use the geometry of `ggplot2`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_fecha, 
       aes(x = fecha_reporte_web, y = casos)) +
  geom_line()
```

And we get the following graph:

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_fecha, 
       aes(x = fecha_reporte_web, y = casos)) +
  geom_line()
```

#### Example 3: Bar Chart

Now, let's create a bar chart visualization of the total positive cases by sex. For this, we use the `geom_bar()` command as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = covid19) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = sexo))
```

In this example, we can see that `ggplot2` automatically calculates the Y-axis.

#### Example 4. More Complex Bar Chart

First, we will prepare the data in a table that allows counting the number of cases by case location:

```{r}
covid19_ubicacion <- covid19 %>%  
group_by(ubicacion_del_caso) %>%
  summarise(casos = n())
```

Now, using the geometry of `ggplot`, we create the visualization using the `stat = "identity"` argument, which calculates the sum of the `y = casos` variable grouped by the `x = ubicacion_del_caso` variable:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_ubicacion, aes(x = ubicacion_del_caso, y = casos)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

We will get the following graph:

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_ubicacion, aes(x = ubicacion_del_caso, y = casos)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

In this case, we have the bars in a vertical orientation. If we want to place the bars in a horizontal orientation, we can achieve this by using the `coord_flip` command at the end as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_ubicacion, aes(x = ubicacion_del_caso, y = casos)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

Resulting in:

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_ubicacion, aes(x = ubicacion_del_caso, y = casos)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

If we want to order the case location by the number of cases, we can use the `reorder` command on the axis where the case location is. The `reorder` function has two arguments: the first is the variable to be ordered, and the second is the variable that provides the order. In this case, it would be `reorder(ubicacion_del_caso, +casos)` if we want to order from highest to lowest number of cases. The code would be as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(covid19_ubicacion, 
       aes(x = reorder(ubicacion_del_caso, +casos), y = casos)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

And the graph looks like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(covid19_ubicacion, 
       aes(x = reorder(ubicacion_del_caso, +casos), y = casos)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

Question: How would you produce this same graph but in ascending order?

### Scale

In the grammar of graphics in `ggplot2`, the scale refers to how the data values are translated into visual properties. Choosing the appropriate scales is essential for making the graphs interpretable and accurate.

Below, we will see some of the different types of scales available in `ggplot2` and their functions:

::: checklist
#### 1. For **continuous or numerical data**, we have **continuous scales such as:**

-   `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()`: for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.

-   `scale_color_continuous()`: assigns colors to continuous values.

-   `scale_size_continuous()`: assigns size to values.
:::

::: checklist
#### 2. For **categorical or character data**, we have discrete scales such as:

-   `scale_x_discrete()` and `scale_y_discrete()`: for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.

-   `scale_color_discrete()`: assigns colors to discrete values.

-   `scale_shape_discrete()`: assigns different shapes to different discrete values.
:::

::: checklist
#### 3. For **date data**, we have date scales such as:

-   `scale_x_date()` and `scale_y_date()`: for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, when dealing with date data.
:::

::: checklist
#### 4. To use custom scales, we use manual scales where we can specify our own values.

-   `scale_color_manual()`: manually specifies colors for values.

-   `scale_shape_manual()`: manually specifies shapes for values.
:::

::: checklist
#### 5. Other scales:

-   `scale_fill_*`: used similarly to color scales but for fill colors.

-   `scale_size_area()`: assigns values to the area instead of the diameter, which can be useful for points.

-   `scale_linetype()`: for different line types

-   `scale_y_log10()`: to use a logarithmic scale on the y-axis.

-   `scale_colour_gradient()`: creates a color gradient between low and high or `scale_colour_gradient2()` for low, medium, and high.

Below, we will see some examples of how to use scales in `ggplot2` with the previously loaded `covid19` data frame.

#### Example 5. Graph with Logarithmic Scale

We will use the same example as before, but in this case, we add the logarithmic scale `scale_y_log10()` at the end as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(covid19_ubicacion, 
       aes(x = reorder(ubicacion_del_caso, -casos), y = casos)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_log10(name = "Confirmed Cases (log scale)")
```

In this way, the new graph would look like this:

```{r echo =FALSE}
ggplot(covid19_ubicacion, 
       aes(x = reorder(ubicacion_del_caso, -casos), y = casos)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_log10(name = "Confirmed Cases (log scale)")
```

::: discussion
What differences do you see with the last graph in Example 4?
:::

### Facets

Facets in the grammar of graphics are a way to divide the data into subsets and represent them in multiple panels within the same graph. This allows us to visualize different aspects of the data or compare groups more effectively. In `ggplot2`, we can use the `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` function to implement facets, depending on the number of variables to use for creating the panels.

#### Example 5. Graph with Facet Wrap

First, we will prepare the data in a table that allows counting the number of cases by `age` and `sex`:

```{r}
covid19_sexo <- covid19 %>%
  group_by(edad, sexo) %>%
  summarise(casos = n())
```

Using the `covid-19` data, we will represent the `cases` variable by `age` in two panels by `sex` using `facet_wrap` as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = covid19_sexo, aes(x = edad, y = casos)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~sexo)
```

::: challenge
Based on what you have learned earlier, think about how you could make each facet a different color, that is, assigning color to the `sex` variable. How would the code change?

The graph you should produce is as follows:

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_sexo, aes(x = edad, y = casos)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = sexo)) +
  facet_wrap(~sexo)
```

::: solution
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = covid19_sexo, aes(x = edad, y = casos)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = sexo)) +
  facet_wrap(~sexo)
```
:::
:::

Adding a color gradient scale, we have:

```{r}
ggplot(covid19_sexo, aes(edad, casos)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = casos)) +
  scale_colour_gradient2() +
  facet_wrap(~sexo)
```

### Theme

In the grammar of graphics, the theme refers to the customization of the overall visual appearance of the graph, such as titles, axis labels, backgrounds, colors, font sizes, among other elements. With themes, we can improve the readability and aesthetics of the graphs, ensuring that the information is communicated effectively and attractively.

In `ggplot2`, we can apply a predefined theme using the `theme()` function. Below are some examples of how to use themes in `ggplot2` with the covid19 dataset.

Using the same graph from the previous example, let's compare two themes: `theme_classic()` and `theme_dark()`.

::: discussion
What differences do you find?
:::

#### Example 6. Using theme classic

To use the classic theme, we have:

```{r}
ggplot(data = covid19_sexo, aes(x = edad, y = casos)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~sexo) +
  theme_classic()
```

#### Example 7. Using theme dark

For this theme, we would have the following:

```{r}
ggplot(data = covid19_sexo, aes(x = edad, y = casos)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~sexo) +
  theme_dark()
```

::: callout
To review the list of `theme()` available in `ggplot2`, you can consult
[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html](https://%60ggplot2%60.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html){.uri}
:::

Finally, let's see an example of how to manually modify themes.

#### Example 8. Changing Titles, Subtitles, and Axes

We can use commands like `xlab`, `ylab` to change the names of the axes. Similarly, commands like title and subtitle as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = covid19_sexo, 
       aes(x = edad, y = casos, colour = sexo)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~sexo) +
  labs(
    y = "Daily Cases", x = "Age in Years",
    colour = "Sex",
    title = "Distribution of COVID-19 Cases by Age and Sex in Latin America"
  )
```

::: keypoints

- Recognize the functions that make up the ggplot2 package.
- Create basic graphs with the ggplot2 structure.
