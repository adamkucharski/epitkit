## Topic 1: Introduction

R is a programming language specialized for data analysis, it is free to use and open-source software. On the other hand, RStudio is an R editor also available for free. The difference between R and RStudio is that R is the programming language in which we write the code and RStudio is the development environment that allows us to work with R more easily and user-friendly.

In recent years, the use of R has grown in academia and industry. R, in addition to being a programming language, is also an environment for statistical computing and creating visualizations. R and RStudio are essential tools for the study, analysis, and decision-making in public health, as they allow for detailed statistical analysis, modeling the spread of diseases, effectively visualizing data, and automating tasks. These tools facilitate data manipulation and preparation, promote collaboration in data science projects, and evidence-based decision-making. Additionally, they are useful in training and education in data analysis for health professionals, STEM areas, and decision-making.

## Topic 2: Installation of R and RStudio

To install R and RStudio, we need to go to our trusted browser. There we will search for r-project, which is the official R page (<https://www.r-project.org/>). Remember that this is free software, there is no need to make any payment for its download or use.

![](fig/pagina_r.png)

Look for the download option "download R" and follow the instructions.

To install RStudio, we need to go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> and look for where it says Install RStudio. If we have Windows, we can click on the blue box. If it is another operating system, below we will find a list with the different options. To install, follow the instructions.

![](fig/instalar_r.png)

Remember to run the downloaded file by following the steps. It is recommended that during the installation we choose the option to leave a shortcut on the desktop.

To check that the installation was successful and in general to use R and RStudio, we need to look for where RStudio was installed and double-click or right-click and open. The first thing we see when opening RStudio is the following screen:

![](fig/pantalla_r.png)

Type 2+2 where the cursor appears and press enter, if you get the result 4, everything is ready to start!

![](fig/2mas2.png)

## Topic 3: RStudio Environment

RStudio is composed of 4 main sections:

![](fig/partes_pantalla.png)

1.  **Editor (top left section)**: in this section, we write and edit the code through the creation of Scripts. This section is essential for code reproducibility. This editor allows us to save the code for future use. The code can be executed in this section by positioning the text cursor at the end of the line of code to be executed; another option is selecting it and using the `Control+Enter` command for Windows or `Command+Enter` for Mac.

2.  **Environment (top right section)**: in this section, we can visualize the objects, data, and functions created or imported in the code we write in the Scripts, for example, objects such as vectors, arrays, `data.frames` or data tables, graphical objects from `ggplot`, among others.

3.  **Console (bottom left section)**: this section is where the code is executed. Not only the code we have written in the editor is executed here, but the code can also be written and executed directly here by pressing `Enter`. However, when the code is executed directly in the console, the commands we execute are not stored, and when the R session is closed, they are lost.

4.  **Viewer (bottom right section)**: in this section, we can visualize the files in "`Files`", the graphs in "`Plots`", the packages that are already installed in "`Packages`", the R help with information about the packages and their functionality in "`Help`", and web pages in "`Viewer`".

## Topic 4: Setting up a project in RStudio

One of the great advantages of using RStudio is the possibility of using R Projects (R Project) (indicated by a `.Rproj` file) which allows organizing the workspace, history, and source documents. To create a Project in R, it is important to follow these steps:

::: challenge
1.  Open RStudio and, in the top left corner, select the **File** tab -\> **New Project...**.

![](fig/file_new_project.png)

2.  A window with the header **New Project Wizard**: **Create Project** will be displayed, now select **New Directory**.

![](fig/proyecto_r.png)

3.  In the window with the header **New Project Wizard**:**Project Type**, select **New Project**
    ![](fig/tipo_projecto.png)

4.  In the window with the header **New Project Wizard**:**Create New Project**. In the **Directory Name** box, enter the desired name for your project (e.g. "`IntroR`").\
    ![](fig/projectoR_introR.png)

5.  Click on the **Browse....** button to search for the location on your computer where you want to save the project
    ![](fig/browse.png)

6.  Create a new folder with the same name as the project (e.g. "`IntroR`"), as well as the subfolders needed to organize your work and results: data, scripts, and figures. In the end, the project should look like this image:

![](fig/proyecto_r_revision.png)

## Topic 5: Data types and operators in R

::: checklist
### Data types

R has the ability to store and process different types of data. Among these are:

-   Decimal numbers `(double. e.g. 3.3)`
-   Integers `(integer. e.g. 3)`
-   Characters `(character. e.g. Municipality, gender, or name.)`
-   Booleans or logical `(logic. e.g. FALSE, TRUE)`
-   Date types `(date. e.g. 01/01/2022)`
-   Data `NA`, `NAN`, and `Inf`. The difference between `NA`, `NAN`, and `Inf` is that `NA` indicates missing data, `NAN` means "not a number"; that is, there is information, but it is an error and the result is not numeric, for example `0/0`. Inf indicates that there are operations whose result is infinite, such as `1/0`. If operations are performed between variable types, `Inf` can be obtained.
:::

::: checklist
### Mathematical and logical operators

Operators are mathematical tools that allow us to perform different tasks with the data we have available; for example, with the `+` operator, we can perform an addition or increment an index. Some of the most commonly used operators in R are:\
1. Arithmetic operators (e.g. `+`, `-`, `*`, which correspond to addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively)\
2. Comparison operators `(e.g. <, >, ==, >=, <=, !=)` 3. Boolean operators `(& (and), | (or), ! (not))`
:::

### Assignment operators \<- and =

\<- This is a common operator in R to assign a certain value to a variable, and the scope is within the function and also outside of it.

*Example*

```{r}
name <- "Laura"
```

An object will have been created in the global environment (locate it in the top right section): ![](fig/nombrelaura.png)

= This operator is used to set a parameter to a value within a function. The scope is only within the function. The variable still contains its original value outside the function.

## Topic 6: Functions

Let's imagine a function as a kind of "magic box" that receives certain data or information as input and produces a specific result or answer as output. It's like following a recipe that takes ingredients and results in a delicious dish.

To use a function, we must provide input data that goes into the box (the function) and from there comes a result or output data. The function can be addition, subtraction, logistic regression, or a mathematical model. Data goes in, and other data comes out as a result of the operations in the function.

::: checklist
### Basic components of a function

The basic components of a function are:

-   **`name`**: the name given to the function (e.g. myfun).

-   **`formals`**: the series of elements that control how to call the function.

-   **`body`**: the series of operations or modifications to the arguments.

-   **`output`**: the results after modifying the arguments. If this output corresponds to a series of data, we can extract it using the `return` command.
:::

**Example**: with a data frame, we want to generate a variable that is the result of an operation, for example, BMI (body mass index).

The BMI function is known ($$weight/(height^2 )$$), and its arguments are weight and height.

Remember that in this formula, the weight must be in kg and the height in meters.

For this example, the input data are the weight and the height variable, and the output would be the body mass index. If we have a weight of 50kg and a height of 1.5m, the BMI will be equal to 22.2.

![](fig/ilustracion_imc.png)

(Illustration adapted by Maria Paula Forero)

In R, we can produce the BMI function with the following code:

```{r}
BMI <- function(weight_kg, height_m) { # Here are the arguments or input
    result <- weight_kg/ height_m^2  # This is the body or operation       
    return(result)           # This is the output or result
 }
```

Now, let's use the function to calculate the BMI of a person with a height of 1.75 cm and a weight of 80 kg, with the following code

```{r}
BMI(weight_kg = 80, height_m = 1.75)
```

As you can see, to use the function once established, you only need the name and the arguments.

::: challenge
**Challenge**: Using the same function, calculate your BMI.
:::

In general, a function consists of a sequence of instructions to carry out a task. In this way, by using functions, it is possible to systematize complex processes that are performed routinely.

### Packages or libraries

In R, packages, also called "libraries," refer to sets of functions organized logically that can be used to carry out various tasks, such as analysis, cleaning, and visualization of data, among others.

::: checklist
#### The most commonly used libraries in R are:

-   **`ggplot2`**: used for creating high-quality graphs and visualizations.
-   **`dplyr`**: allows efficient data manipulation and transformation.
-   **`tidyr`**: used to organize and reorganize data into a tidy tabular format.
-   **`readr`**: used to read and write data in formats such as `CSV`, `TSV`, and others.
-   **`plyr`**: used to split, apply, and combine data efficiently.
:::

There are also meta-libraries, which combine several libraries. An example of these is the `tidyverse` library.

## Topic 7: Data structures in R

### Vector

In R, a vector is an indexed data structure that allows storing multiple elements of the same type in a single structure. For example, we could have a vector that contains the ages of several people or a vector that contains the names of different cities.

Vectors in R are useful because they allow performing operations and calculations easily. The elements of the vector can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided, and their elements are accessible by position or index.

In summary, a vector in R is an ordered collection of elements of the same data type (see Topic 5) that allows storing and manipulating data efficiently.

To create a vector in the code or script, write the name by which it will be recognized (e.g. age or city) and then write the symbol `<-` (which gives the order to R to create the vector). Then write the letter c, which is the assignment that allows initializing the vector. Each component must be separated by commas, if they are characters, they must be in quotes (if they are numbers, they do not), if it is a boolean data (false or true), it also does not go in quotes.

::: challenge
Thus, vectors can be created by executing the `c()` command, as shown below:

Examples

```{r}
name <- c("Emilia", "Maximo", "Axel", "Diana") # Names of the people

city <- c("La Plata","Concepción", "Cuzco", "Bogota") # City of residence

age <- c(18, 20, 37, 42)  # Age of the people

vaccinated <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) # Vaccination status

doses <- c(2L, 0L, 1L, 2L) # Number of doses received`
```
:::

::: callout
Note: *The use of the `#` symbol allows commenting on the code, that is, adding notes that explain one or more lines of the code.*
:::

### Data.frame (Data table)

Let's imagine a `data.frame` as a table with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet in Excel. Each column represents a specific type of information (a vector) or variable (For example, age, department, or name). In this example, each row corresponds to the record of those variables for an individual. It is important to keep in mind that `data.frames` (Data tables) are composed of vectors whose dimensions must be equal, that is, all columns must have the same number of rows. Following the analogy of Excel, we can think that each vector is a column of an Excel sheet.

One advantage of working with `Data.frame` in R instead of an Excel sheet is that as the size of the table increases, it is possible to work faster and more efficiently in R.

To create a data table, the `data.frame()` command must be executed. For example, using the vectors we defined in the previous section:

```{r}
vaccine_data <- data.frame(
  name = name, 
  city = city,
  age = age,
  vaccinated = vaccinated,
  doses = doses)
```

Now let's see how the data table looks

```{r}
vaccine_data
```

::: checklist
### Parts of a data.frame

Some functions that allow us to know characteristics such as names or sizes of the rows or columns of the `data.frame` are:

-   `colnames()`: column names

-   `rownames()`: row names

-   `nrow()`: number of rows

-   `ncol()`: number of columns

-   `length()`: length of the data table
:::

Now, to access the description of the general structure of a data table (and in general any R object), we use the `str` command, in this case, we write:

```{r}
str(vaccine_data)
```

This tells us that the structure (`vaccine_data`) corresponds to a `data.frame` with 4 observations and 5 variables.

If we use the `str(vaccine_data$name)` command, we can see the structure of that variable, which in this case is a character vector with a length of 1 to 4.

```{r}
str(vaccine_data$name)
```

To access the different components of the data table, we use the syntax `[,]`, where the first dimension corresponds to rows and the second dimension to columns.

::: discussion
For example, if we want to know how many vaccine doses Maximo received, what should we do?
:::

Let's see which row and column this data corresponds to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
vaccine_data
```

![](fig/maximo.png)

We see that Maximo is in row 2 and the doses in column 5. Therefore, the intersection of these two variables will give us the number of doses Maximo received.

```{r}
vaccine_data[2, 5] 
```

### Creating and opening data tables

R allows us not only to create data tables but also to open files that contain them. In fact, most of the time, data frames are not created directly in R but imported from some data source, for example, the database of the surveillance system of an event of interest.

::: checklist
### Data sources

For this, in R, there are three sources of data sets that we can use:

-   Imported data table (from formats such as `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.stata`, or `.RDS`, among others)
-   Data table that is part of an R package (e.g. `MASS`, `islands`, etc.)
-   Data table created during the R session (e.g. the structures from the first exercises)
:::

### Importing a data table

To import a data table from different sources, we need to use different types of functions.

Here are some examples of the type of data, the library that needs to be loaded, and the function to use.

|                   |                                  |             |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Data type**     | **Function**                     | **Package** |
| csv               | `read_csv`                       | `readr`     |
| xls               | `read_excel, read_xls,read_xlsx` | `readxl`    |
| RDS               | `readRDS`                        | `base`      |
| dta               | `read_dta`                       | `haven`     |
| sas               | `read_sas`                       | `haven`     |

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

**Reminder**: If you want to store the data in an object, you must use the assignment operator. 
 
Example: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
library("package that contains the function")
data <- function_read("data_address.format")
```

## Topic 8: Data manipulation with `tidyverse`

`tidyverse` is a meta-library that combines several libraries.
`tidyverse` comes from the word "tidy," which in English refers to organizing, cleaning, and arranging, in this case, performing these actions on data. Therefore, `tidyverse` is a way of referring to the universe of these actions in R.

`tidyverse`, being a meta-library, will automatically load several libraries such as (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `tibble`, `readr`, `purr`, among others) that are useful for data manipulation.

To install a library, we use the `install.packages` command. This only needs to be done once on our computer. Let's see how we can use it to install tidyverse:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

To call or import an already installed library, we use the `library` command. This command must be executed every time we restart R or open RStudio.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
<center>  
   
[![](fig/dudas.png){width="100"}](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epitkit/Banco_errores.html)

### Opening and exploring an imported data table from Excel

::: callout
This is the dataset for this practice:
[datos_covid.xlsx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRACE-LAC/TRACE-LAC-data/main/datos_covid.xlsx)

Within the directory we are currently working in, we need to create a folder called *data*.\
Now we need to save the downloaded data table in the data folder we just created.
:::

To import data tables from `RDS`, we can use the `read_excel` function, which is in the `readxl` package linked to `tidyverse`. However, it is still necessary to load the `readxl` library, as it is not a core `tidyverse` package. For this, we write in the console:

```{r}
library(readxl) 
 
dat <- read_excel("data/datos_covid.xlsx")
```

Now an object of type `data.frame` has been created. ![](fig/read_excel.png)

Next, we will see some of the most commonly used functions of `tidyverse`.

### Pipe operator (*pipe*)

The pipe operator `%>%` is a key operator in `tidyverse`, which allows the user to emphasize a sequence of actions on an object. Additionally, the use of this operator reduces the amount of code and improves performance.

**Example 1:** In the following diagram, we can see the functioning of the pipe function that allows applying different functions to a dataset and their results.

![](fig/pipe.png)

(Illustration adapted by Maria Paula Forero)

Let's compare the code when we use vs when we don't use the pipe. For this, we need to load the dplyr library and create an example data table

```{r}
library(dplyr) # This library is automatically loaded with tidyverse 

data <- data.frame(age = c(12, 23, 32, 60), doses = c(1, 2, 3, 1))
```

The code from the previous diagram without using the pipe operator would be as follows:

```{r}
filtered_data <- filter(data, age > 18) 

data_with_scheme <- mutate(filtered_data, 
                            scheme = ifelse(doses > 2, "Complete", "Incomplete")) 

grouped_data <- group_by(data_with_scheme, scheme)

data_by_scheme <- summarise(grouped_data, people = n())
```

Now, with the help of a pipe, we have:

```{r}
data_by_scheme <- 
  filter(data, age > 18) %>% 
  mutate( scheme = ifelse(doses > 2, "Complete", "Incomplete")) %>%
  group_by(scheme) %>% 
  summarise(people = n())
```

::: checklist
### Basic functions of `tidyverse`

-   **`glimpse()`**: used to quickly explore a data table.

-   **`group_by()`**: creates groups within a data table.

-   **`summarise()`**: returns one row for each combination of grouped variables.

-   **`select()`**: selects columns from a data table.

-   **`filter()`**: filters rows from a data table based on a condition of values.

-   **`arrange()`**: sorts rows from a data table by the value of a particular variable if it is numeric, or alphabetically if it is a character.

-   **`mutate()`**: generates a new variable.

-   **`rename()`**: changes the name of a variable.
:::

Let's take a closer look at the most common functions of the `dyplr` package within `tidyverse`.

-   **`glimpse`**

    This function is used to quickly glance at our data and explore information such as: the number of rows (which in this case would be the number of observations or data of our population), the number of columns and their names (which in this case would be the number of variables and their names). Between "\< \>" we will find the data type (`dbl` for double, `chr` for character, among others) and a brief list of some of the first values of the data. For example, the `glimpse` function can be applied to the *dat* element (loaded above) as follows:

    ```{r}
    dat %>% glimpse()
    ```

-   **`summarise`**

    The `summarise` function allows us to apply certain operations of interest to a data table. For example, to calculate the mean age, we use the `mean()` function and for the total count of cases, we use the `n()` function:

    ```{r}
    dat %>% summarise(mean = mean(age), cases= n())
    ```

-   **`group_by`**

The `group_by` function does not have an obvious use if used alone, as an internal process of grouping the data occurs. However, when used with other functions such as `summarise`, its effect can be seen. For example, the following command groups the data by gender and calculates, for each group, the count of cases and their corresponding mean age:

```{r}
dat %>% group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(cases = n(), mean_age = mean(age))
```

-   **`select`**

    The `select` function is useful when we want to select one or more columns from a `data.frame` or data table. For example, we can select the age and gender variables from *dat* with the following command:

    ```{r}
    dat %>% select(age, gender) #using the column name
    ```

-   **`filter`**

This function can be used to filter a data table based on a logical condition of the value of its rows. For example, to filter records younger than 28 years old, we use:

```{r}
dat %>% filter(age < 28)
```

As you can see, the result contains all the variables of the table, but the data is limited to those with an age less than 28 years. Now, let's filter the records that are younger than 28 years old and female. In this case, to include records of 28 years old as well, we no longer use only the "<" sign but accompany it with the "=" symbol:

Let's see an example with a double filter:

```{r}
dat %>% filter(gender == "F", age <= 28) #Now you know how to filter by gender
```

-   **`arrange`**

To organize the data by one or more variables, we can use the `arrange` function. For example, to organize the data by age, or by age and gender:

```{r}
dat %>% arrange(age) 

dat %>% arrange(age,gender)
```

By default, the function organizes the values from smallest to largest; if we want to organize them from largest to smallest, we can use `desc` within the `arrange` function.

```{r}
dat %>% arrange(desc(age))
```

-   **`mutate`**

    To create a new column with data in a `data.frame` from an existing one, the `mutate` function is useful. This function requires the name of the column to be created and the column from which we want to copy the data. The new column will be placed at the end of the variables in the data table by default. In this example, we will create a variable called country in which we use the `country_name` variable but in uppercase with `toupper`

    ```{r}
    dat %>% mutate(GENDER= toupper(gender)) %>% select(GENDER)
    ```

-   **`rename`**

If we do not want to create a new variable but rename an existing one, it is convenient to use the `rename` function. For example, to change the name `country_name` to `country`, we use:

```{r}
dat %>% rename(age_years = age)
```

-   **`slice`**

We have already seen how to select columns using the `select` function. If we need to select specific rows from a `data.frame`, the `slice` function is very useful. For example, to select rows 10 to 15:

```{r}
dat %>% slice(10:15)
```

If you want to modify an already created object with these functions, you must also use the assignment operator.
Example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
object <- object %>% mutate(new_column = new_content)
```

If done without assignment, the change will only be reflected in the console. Remember to be sure you want to save the change (this action could be irreversible). If you want to know more about common errors and how to prevent them, visit our error bank.

::: challenge
## Reinforcement activity:

For this activity, we need to load a different type of data. In the following link, you can download the data [data_challenge](https://github.com/TRACE-LAC/TRACE-LAC-data/raw/refs/heads/main/otros/datos_limpios_covid.RDS).
The data can be loaded from the computer or from an online location. To load the `datos_limpios_covid.RDS` data directly from the internet, use the following commands:

```{r eval = FALSE}
url <- "https://github.com/TRACE-LAC/TRACE-LAC-data/raw/refs/heads/main/otros/datos_limpios_covid.RDS"

covid19 <- readr::read_rds(url)
```

After loading the data, you should do the following:

1.  Explore the data
2.  Group the data by `country_name` and count the cases for each one.
3.  Filter the data for Peru (Tip: observe how the country name is written in the `country_name` variable).
4.  Group the data by `gender` and count the cases for each one.
5.  Group the data by `country_name` and calculate the mean age for each one.
6.  Change the name of `status` to `severity`.
7.  Sort the data by `gender` and select the first 5 rows of each one.
8.  Create a table that shows how many people with each `symptom` appear in the database located in Colombia.
